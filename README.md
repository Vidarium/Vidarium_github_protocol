The repositories available correspond to research projects done by the center. One repository  per project (either public or private depending on the privacy of the data and stage of the project). The name for the repository is recommended to be short and using key words that describe the project. Example: Vidarium_github_protocol

Inside each repository one should find: 
1.	README.md file which should include
-	To which research project the repository belongs to: Authors, year, title, journal -if published-.
-	A short description of what can be found in the repository. It must specify which are the files available and what they are used for. 
Example: The file Script_project1.R is a commented R script that requires the provided database file Database_project1.csv to properly run.  
-	If considered important one can report what versions of programs or languages were used. 
Example: R software 3.6.1
-	Optionally include a short description of the “step-by-step” process the main script follows. 
-	Installation or running instructions if needed.
-	Other important data inherent to each project.

2.	Files required according to the project (It may include files in various formats). Usually, these are the main script and the input files to run it. But it could also be extra databases, metadata, raw data, a needed package, provided programs, etc.

3.	LICENSE file only if considered required for the project. GitHub offers various types of licenses with different legal implications.  The type of license is selected at the moment of the repository creation; however, it is set by default to none.
